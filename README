Console_GetoptLong
==================

Console_GetoptLong is a module for reading command line options.

It differs from all other PHP command line option reading modules in several
important ways:

 * it puts the results directly into referenced variables.
 * it has a simple description to variable mapping
 * it deals with multiple synonyms per option, short and long
 * it returns a list of all the arguments that weren't options

Argument descriptions
=====================

getOptions is the main function provided by Console_GetoptLong and is the
only function you should need to call.

It takes an array where the keys are descriptions of how each
option should be processed and the values are references to the
variable to set when that option is supplied on the command line.

The arguments are described in description => reference pairs.

The description is a list of synonyms (separated by | characters)
possibly followed by a specifier for the arguments to the option.
That specifier starts with a = (mandatory) or : (optional), then
either i (integer), s (string) or f (floating point).  This can
also be followed by an @ symbol, meaning to store multiple 
values in an array.  Alternately, the specifier can be +, which
means that more than one of this option on the command line increments
the references variable, or !, which means that the option is a flag
but also takes a 'no' prefix (e.g. --sort and --nosort).

Some examples are best supplied here:

quiet|q          = a single flag, takes no arguments
ouput|o=s        = an option with a mandatory string argument
debug|d:i        = an option with an optional integer argument
input|i=s@       = take multiple instances, store in array
verbose|v+       = more -v options increment the verbosity
invert!          = takes --invert and --noinvert

So we might ask for those arguments to be processed from the command
line with the following invocation:

$args = Console_GetoptLong::getOptions(
     'quiet|q'       => &$quiet,
     'verbose|v+'    => &$verbose,
     'input|i=s@'    => &$inputs,
     'output|o=s'    => &$outupt,
     'debug|d+'      => &$debug,
);

Argument descriptions can be in any order (naturally).  Each option
can have one or more synonyms, or none.  Both single dash (-) and
double dash (--) are taken to signify options of any length (i.e.
the above description allows you to specify -input and --i as well
as the more usual -i and --input).

If you do not supply a @ descriptor, but reference an array, the items
will be put into the array automatically (i.e. the argument will be
treated as if described by @).
 
Returned values
===============

getOptions returns the remaining list of command line parameters that
weren't options or their arguments.  These can occur anywhere in the
command line, so (with the above argument description) it would be
valid to call the related program with the arguments:

-v -v convert_to_proteins -i viruses.fasta -o viruses.prot

Which would then return an array with the word 'convert_to_proteins'.
